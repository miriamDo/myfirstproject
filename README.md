*   The second microservice will be built on the PHP Laravel framework.
*   The third microservice will be based on JavaScript using React.
*   Additionally, you will need to configure networking and volumes in Docker.
*   Implement a multi-stage Docker build process to optimize the size of the final Docker images.
